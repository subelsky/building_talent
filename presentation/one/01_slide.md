# Cultural Side-Effects

* Seeded our training culture (checklists)
* Promoted documentation-driven development
* Heavy TDD emphasis
* Streamlined dev environment setup
* Introduced new perspectives / backgrounds

<!SLIDE bullets incremental>

# What To Do Next Time

* Use professional trainers
* Use pre-configured cloud-based VMs
* Focus on language & framework vs. our tech
* Focus on open-source work

<!SLIDE bullets incremental>

# What To Do Next Time

* Assign individual mentors
* Provide admin support
* Separate version for mid-or-late career devs

<!SLIDE bullets incremental>

# How to get started

* Make your systems modular, habitable
* Identify maintenance tasks
* Apply "moneyball" techniques in hiring
* Start a beginner's meetup
* Start an intermediate-level meetup

<!SLIDE bullets incremental>

# How to get started

* Organize RailsGirls or equivalent event
* Don't send pizza to meetups; send trainers
* Partner with software training schools
* Big company: replicate [Hungry Academy](http://www.hungryacademy.com/)
* Small company: cooperate on a joint Hungry Academy
* Establish fellowships (a la [Fractured Atlas](http://www.fracturedatlas.org/site/blog/2014/03/12/new-summer-software-development-fellowship/))

# Implications for Diversity in Tech

* 25-50% of programming is not writing code
* Not everyone learns programming the same way
* Mentorship, apprenticeship &hArr; more diverse candidate pool
* Education system can't/shouldn't solve this problem
